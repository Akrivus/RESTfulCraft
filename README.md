![RESTfulCraft](./src/main/resources/META-INF/restfulcraft.png)

Introducing software development concepts to Minecraft by turning worlds into a RESTful web service that allows players to create, view, update, and destroy blocks with code or tools such as Postman or cURL.

## Configuration
There are two configuration settings for RESTfulCraft.
- `authKey` is the required value of the `Authentication` header. **Do not put your password here.**
- `port` is the server API port. By default, it is `56552`.

## Documentation
